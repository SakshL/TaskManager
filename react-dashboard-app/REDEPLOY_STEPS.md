# Vercel Redeployment Steps

## Current Status
- All code changes are committed and pushed to the main branch
- Vercel CLI is installed and ready
- `vercel.json` configuration is correct

## Steps to Redeploy:

### 1. Log in to Vercel CLI
From the current terminal prompt, choose your login method:
- **Recommended**: "Continue with GitHub" (if your repo is on GitHub)
- Follow the browser authentication flow

### 2. Deploy with Vercel CLI
After logging in, run these commands:

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# OR if you want to see a preview first
vercel

# If you have an existing project, you can also force redeploy
vercel --prod --force
```

### 3. Alternative: Trigger Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard
If you have access to your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your TaskTide project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. Make sure it's deploying from the correct branch (main)

### 4. Environment Variables Check
Make sure these environment variables are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 5. Verification
After deployment:
1. Visit your live URL
2. Test the new features:
   - Study Material Organizer
   - Grade Tracker
   - Feedback Page
   - Enhanced Chat Assistant
   - Improved Login/Signup
   - New sidebar navigation

## Troubleshooting
If the deployment still shows old content:
1. Check if Vercel is deploying from the correct repository and branch
2. Clear Vercel build cache: `vercel --prod --force`
3. Ensure the build directory is set to `dist` in Vercel settings
4. Check that the deployment is happening from the `react-dashboard-app` directory
