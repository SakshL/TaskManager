# Email Verification Route Fix

## Problem
The `/verify` route was redirecting to the React app dashboard instead of serving the `verify.html` file.

## Root Cause
React Router's catch-all route (`*`) was intercepting the `/verify` route before Vercel could serve the static file.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/verify",
      "destination": "/verify.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/verify.html",
      "destination": "/verify.html"
    },
    {
      "source": "/favicon.png",
      "destination": "/favicon.png"
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "destination": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/_redirects",
      "destination": "/_redirects"
    },
    {
      "source": "/((?!verify\\.html$|favicon\\.png$|assets/|_redirects$).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

The key change is using a negative lookahead regex to exclude specific files from being routed to the React app.

### 2. Updated `_redirects` File
```plaintext
/verify                /verify.html           200
/verify.html           /verify.html           200
/*                     /index.html            200
```

### 3. Added React Router Protection
Added a check in `App.tsx` to prevent React Router from handling the `/verify` route:

```tsx
// If we're on the verify route, don't render the React app
if (location.pathname === '/verify' || location.pathname === '/verify.html') {
  // This should never actually render since Vercel should serve the static file
  // But if it does, redirect to the actual verify.html file
  window.location.href = '/verify.html' + window.location.search;
  return null;
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Serve locally: `npx serve dist`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/verify?actionCode=test` 
4. Should show the verification page, not redirect to dashboard

### Production Testing
1. After deployment, test: `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/verify?actionCode=test`
2. Should serve the verification page correctly
3. Email verification links should work end-to-end

## Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing for email verification page"
git push
```

Changes will auto-deploy to Vercel. The verification route should now work correctly!

## Verification Flow
1. User signs up
2. Firebase sends verification email with link like: `https://yourdomain.vercel.app/verify?mode=verifyEmail&actionCode=xxx&continueUrl=https://yourdomain.vercel.app/dashboard`
3. User clicks link â†’ Vercel serves `verify.html` (not React app)
4. JavaScript in `verify.js` handles the verification
5. On success, redirects to dashboard or shows success message
6. On error, shows appropriate error message
